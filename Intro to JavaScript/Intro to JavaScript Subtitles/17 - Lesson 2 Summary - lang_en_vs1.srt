1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,510
That about wraps it up for
data types and variables.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,950
You should congratulate
yourself on a job well done.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,820
That was a huge lesson.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,280
&gt;&gt; In this lesson, we covered all
the basic data types in JavaScript,

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,860
including numbers, strings,
boolean, null and undefined.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,300
Also, we looked at how you can
store data into variables.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,763
&gt;&gt; Don't forget operations
on numbers and strings.

8
00:00:22,763 --> 00:00:23,590
Right, that too.

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,640
In the next lesson, we'll build upon
your new knowledge of data types and

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,230
variables to learn how to write
code to solve logical problems.

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:31,640
See you there.
