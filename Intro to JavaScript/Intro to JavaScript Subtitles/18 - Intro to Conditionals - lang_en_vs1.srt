00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,029
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:04,990
In the last lesson,
you got a basic understanding for

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,610
how data is represented and
stored in the variables.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,990
But what good is that data
if you can't put it to use?

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,080
&gt;&gt; When you're writing code,
the main goal is to solve a problem.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,490
The steps your code takes to solve
a problem is known as an algorithm.

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,310
Ultimately, for any code that you write,
you will be breaking down a problem

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,630
into an algorithm that is
executed by a computer.

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,850
&gt;&gt; Let me try explaining it another way.

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,860
Let's imagine you're the computer.

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,200
Do you remember the last time you had to
decide whether to purchase something?

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,050
How did you solve that problem?

13
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,150
Besides figuring out if you
really wanted or needed the item,

14
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,980
your decision to purchase the item was
ultimately dependent on whether or

15
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,500
not you had enough money to purchase it.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,130
So you ask yourself, self, do I have
enough money to purchase this item?

17
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,950
If you answered, yes,
then you purchase the item.

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,650
But if you answered, no,
then you didn't purchased the item.

19
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,230
The process you went through in
your head to solve that problem,

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,580
and the steps you took
in order to do so,

21
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,880
is really what's at
the heart of writing code.

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,339
And that's what you'll be
learning in this lesson.

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,480
&gt;&gt; Up next, you'll see a flowchart.

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,170
A flowchart is just a diagram for
how to solve a problem.

25
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,400
Take a look at it, and
try to answer the next question.
