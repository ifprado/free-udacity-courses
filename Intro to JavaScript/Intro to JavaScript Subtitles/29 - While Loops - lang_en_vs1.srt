1
00:00:00,298 --> 00:00:02,719
Remember how I said loops could
be used to count to a million?

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,520
Well, we're not going to do that.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,302
We're going to count to 10,000 instead,
starting with x equals 1.

4
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:13,680
Hey look, we're already done,
1 mississippi!

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,590
We're on our way to 10,000 already.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,981
Just so you know,
counting to 10,000 is a tough task, and

7
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:24,150
like many tough tasks,
it's good to work on them incrementally.

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,355
Let's increase the value of x by 1.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,460
This is awesome.

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,220
See, we're making progress.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,360
In no time,
we'll be all the way to 10,000.

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,510
Yay, look how far you've gotten.

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,520
Okay, let's keep going.

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,490
Hey, wait a minute!

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,141
This is all the same code.

16
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:48,011
So repeating the same code over and
over and

17
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:52,232
over again is definitely not going
to be the best option for us,

18
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:56,800
if we want to print out all
the numbers between 1 and 10,000.

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,230
There has to be a better way.

20
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,620
And you know what?

21
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,942
There is a better way, loops.

22
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:06,612
Using a loop will let you
iterate over values and

23
00:01:06,612 --> 00:01:09,120
repeatedly run a block of code.

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,190
In this case,
the block of code you want to repeat, is

25
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,556
incriminating the value of x and using
console.log to print out the message.

26
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,430
The only piece you really need to
start your loop is right here but

27
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,460
we'll need to tweak it a bit.

28
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,070
Now, this code shows x
starting at the value of 1,

29
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:33,000
and then it prints out the value of
x and finally, x is incremented.

30
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,353
And because we want to do these two
steps all the way until we reach 10,000,

31
00:01:39,353 --> 00:01:41,060
we'll wrap that code in a loop.

32
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,701
This particular type of loop
is called a while loop.

33
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:49,283
As long as this condition is true,

34
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:54,372
the loop will print out the number and
increment the value of x by 1.

35
00:01:54,372 --> 00:01:57,371
And then it will restart if
the condition at the top of the loop is

36
00:01:57,371 --> 00:01:58,630
still true.

37
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:04,470
So congratulations, in just five lines
of code you can count to 10,000 and

38
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,350
pretty much any number
you'd like to count to.
