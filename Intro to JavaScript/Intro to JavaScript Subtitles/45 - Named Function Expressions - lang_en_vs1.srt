00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,133
You so how you can write
an anonymous function expression,

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:05,950
store it in a variable.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,600
And then,
call it using the variable name.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,213
You can also create name
function expression,

5
00:00:11,213 --> 00:00:13,880
where the function actually has a name.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,330
Like this one, for example,
the function is called Movie.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,330
Calling the function is
no different than before.

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,940
Just use the variable name,
not the function's name to call it.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,600
If you did try to call this function by
its name, you'd get a reference error.
