00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,060
Congrats, you made it.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,720
Functions can be a bit tricky at first,
but they're so

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,560
fundamental in programming.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,470
&gt;&gt; You learned how to write function
declarations to package up bits of code

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,320
to use inside your programs.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,050
And you learned different ways
to write function expressions so

7
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,060
you can easily pass functions
to other functions.

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,110
&gt;&gt; Next, we're going to look at arrays.

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,790
Arrays are a powerful
JavaScript data type

10
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,540
that will allow you to store data into
a single organized data structure.

11
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,110
&gt;&gt; Go check it out.
