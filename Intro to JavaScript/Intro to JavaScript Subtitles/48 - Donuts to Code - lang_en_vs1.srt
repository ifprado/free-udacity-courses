1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,010
So as you can tell we've got a lot of
donuts that we've gotta keep up with at

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,120
our shop.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,760
And trying to organize all
them is going to be a problem.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,185
We could create individual variables
to keep track of each donut, but

5
00:00:13,185 --> 00:00:16,184
that's going to mean multiple variables,
not so

6
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:19,499
great variable names, and
just a whole lot of mess.

7
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:21,780
It's not exactly the best solution.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:27,200
Instead, to make this easier, we can
use a data structure called an Array.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,270
An array is a data structure that we
can use to store multiple values.

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,940
Also, one thing that makes
arrays really awesome

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,800
is that the values we store
in an array are ordered.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,680
You can almost think of
an array like a numbered list,

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,150
where each item in
the list has a number.

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,920
And we can use that number to refer
back to the item when we need it,

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,618
with the one big difference being that
arrays will start at 0 instead of

16
00:00:49,618 --> 00:00:53,320
starting at 1, but we'll look
at that more in just a second.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,881
An array should work perfectly for
organizing all of our donuts,

18
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:58,119
so let's create one.

19
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:00,545
All right, so
here I've got all of our donuts, but

20
00:01:00,545 --> 00:01:02,929
they're represented as
individual variables.

21
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,041
So we need to fix that,

22
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,862
if we're going to create an array
to hold all of our donuts.

23
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:10,432
So the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm just going to select all of these

24
00:01:10,432 --> 00:01:13,753
variables and we're doing
a little keyboard shortcut magic,

25
00:01:13,753 --> 00:01:17,760
I'll get rid of these semicolons,
I'm going to jump to the front.

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,030
Get rid of these variable
declarations and the equals sign.

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,030
So we're left with just the strings.

28
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,540
Okay, perfect.

29
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,680
So that's number one.

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,370
The next step is we need to
create a variable that can

31
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,910
hold all these strings and
it's going to be our donuts array.

32
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,220
So to do that, I'm going to move
those down a few spaces and

33
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:42,239
I'm going to say var donuts = {};,

34
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:48,040
so the opening and the closing
brackets represent an empty array.

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,970
At this point,
we've got an array, it's empty.

36
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,525
It doesn't have anything in it, but when
we put the opening bracket, it says,

37
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:54,968
hey this variable's an array.

38
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:58,123
And then the closing bracket's
going to show the end of the array,

39
00:01:58,123 --> 00:02:00,233
so that's how we know
that it's an array.

40
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:03,417
Now for the last step, what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take all

41
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:05,569
these strings and
put them into an array.

42
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:09,687
Now, the one thing that you need to make
sure that you do when creating an array,

43
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:13,510
is that you separate each element
in the array with a comma.

44
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,680
Now to do that, I'm going to use some
more keyboard shortcuts here and

45
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,010
I'm going to select all of our lines and
I'm going to put a comma at the end.

46
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,470
Another thing that I'm going to do is
I'm going to get rid of that last comma.

47
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,310
Because chocolate donut
holes is our last element,

48
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,638
we don't need that
extra comma on the end.

49
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:33,559
All right, and we'll do one more thing,
we'll get rid of all of this space,

50
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,580
okay.

51
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,200
And let's just cut this and
move it in to our donuts array.

52
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,100
All right and that's it.
