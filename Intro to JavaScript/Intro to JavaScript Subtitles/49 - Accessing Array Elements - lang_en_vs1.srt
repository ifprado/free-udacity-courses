00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,469
Let's revisit our donuts
array from earlier.

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,470
If you recall,
we created an array of strings where

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,900
each string represents
a donut in our donuts array.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,580
Now, another way of saying
this is that each string or

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,420
donut, is an element
in our donuts array.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,670
The element is kind of an overloaded
word because it's also used to talk

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,460
about HTML elements or tags but
elements in arrays are different.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,090
The word element is used to signify the
individual pieces of data in an array.

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,270
Also, we have a way to access
each element in an array

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,940
by referencing its
location in the array.

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,190
The name that you used to refer to
an element's location is its index.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,530
If you remember back to our
lesson on data types and

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:46,360
variables, we could refer to a specific
character in a string by its index.

14
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,040
Arrays work the exact same way, so

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,520
just like strings, each element in the
array is numbered starting from zero.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,400
And we can just use those
numbers our indices,

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,510
to access whatever value
we want in the array.

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,960
For example, the first element
in the donuts array is glazed,

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,300
the second element is chocolate frosted,
the third element is cinnamon.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,960
And this process is going to
continue until we get to our last

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,100
element in the donuts array,
which are these chocolate donuts holes.

22
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,420
Now the syntax for
this is just the name of the array.

23
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,170
The opening and closing brackets, and

24
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,270
the index of the element
we want to access.

25
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,640
This gives us a much
better way to organize and

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,590
keep track of all
the donuts in our shop.
