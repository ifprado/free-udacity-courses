1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,417
So arrays give us a better option for
storing information inside of

2
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:07,319
one neat data structure,
but what else can they do?

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,610
&gt;&gt; You can actually do
quite a bit with arrays.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,755
You see,
arrays have a number of properties and

5
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:14,225
methods that make them
powerful data structures.

6
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:16,700
&gt;&gt; Man, properties, methods?

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,000
You're about to venture into some
really awesome programming territory.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, things are starting
to get really exciting.

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,080
You can think about properties as
special pieces of information about

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,680
a data structure.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,880
For example, there's a special
property in an array called length.

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,050
&gt;&gt; Wait, haven't we used length before?

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually we have.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,780
Earlier in this course,

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,630
we used length with strings to get
the number of characters in a string.

16
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,440
However, we can also use length to get
the number of elements in an array.

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,220
This is useful when you want
to loop over an array, but

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,400
you're not sure how many elements
you're going to need to loop over.

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,260
&gt;&gt; That's right, so both strings and
arrays use the length property.

20
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,920
&gt;&gt; Yep, and
you've kind of seen methods before too.

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,320
You can think of methods like
special predefined functions

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,420
that a data structure can call.

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,503
Some common array methods you'll see
are reverse, which reverses the order

24
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:13,365
of the elements in an array, sort,
which sorts the elements in an array.

25
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:16,238
And push and pop, which are two
methods that allow us to add and

26
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:17,740
remove elements from an array.

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,400
&gt;&gt; But there are more than just
these methods you see here.

28
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,340
For a full listing of all
the available built-in array methods,

29
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,210
check out the link to
the MDN documentation below.

30
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,460
&gt;&gt; As you continue through this course,
you'll see the words property and

31
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,860
method thrown around a lot,
especially when we get to objects.

32
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,120
Spoiler alert,
arrays are a special kind of object.

33
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,122
But we'll get more into that later.

34
00:01:40,122 --> 00:01:41,860
&gt;&gt; Julie Anne,
that was supposed to be a surprise.

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,370
&gt;&gt; Sorry.

36
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,620
Well, for now let's look at some
properties and methods of an array.
