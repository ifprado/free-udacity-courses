00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,570
There are lots of ways to loop
over arrays in JavaScript, and

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,810
each way has its pros and cons.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,870
For loops are very versatile and

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,520
give you complete control
over the looping process.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,650
You can explicitly define
where to start and

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,610
stop in the array, whether you want
to skip over values in the array, and

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,650
even whether you'd like to break out of
the loop early using a break statement.

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,285
When in doubt, you could
probably use a for loop to do it.

9
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:27,470
.forEach gives you a concise
way of looping over an array

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,330
if you know you're going to be looping
over every element from start to finish.

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,050
You have less versatility than
you do with a regular for

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,910
loop, but you can access each
element directly, which is nice.

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,320
And you don't need an index
of an element to do that.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,200
Map is one more array method you'll
want in your JavaScript tool belt.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,370
Similar to for each,
you can define a call back function

16
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,000
that performs an operation on
each element in the array.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,390
The difference here is,

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,180
map returns a new array with the new
values your function calculated.

19
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,880
So, there you have it.

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,170
There are tons of ways to
iterate over a data in an array.

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,950
And you can check out even more of them
by reading the Mozilla documentation.

22
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,560
But for now,
you got three you can pull from,

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,890
depending on what you
need to accomplish.

24
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,120
For loops, forEach and

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,810
now map, if you need to create
a new array using your function.
